# Your Ultimate Homework

## Terrible news G6!

All the websites that displayed the UK's top 20 songs have simultaneously disappeared! No one knows who is number one - pop groups are rioting, it's carnage in the streets! It's up to you make a simple React app that displays the current UK top 20 songs, and restore order to the pop charts once and for all. You can get the data for this here:

https://itunes.apple.com/gb/rss/topsongs/limit=20/json

### Mega-ultra hint: Remember in the first week of Javascript when Colin practically stopped a lesson and said 'you'll need to remember this?' Remember that thing!

You are required to use a stateless component as part of your app.

The MVP is to request the data, then display the list of songs with each song showing its chart position, title and artist.

## Extensions
Add more information - you could include images or the preview song audio clips. Style this nicely with CSS.

AND/OR

Add a dropdown to choose a genre of music to display - more URLS can be found at this page, just change the 'xml' part to 'json': https://rss.itunes.apple.com/us/?urlDesc=%2Fgenerator

# DIG DEEP, G6 - FIND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT LAY WITHIN YOU ALL ALONG AND BEST YOUR FINAL HOMEWORK, FOR WE BELIEVE IN YOU AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE YOU CANNOT ACHIEVE IF YOU PUT YOUR GLORIOUS MINDS TO IT
